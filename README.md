---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This API leverages the use of generic types to facilitate the parsing of XML data to a collection of objects, as well as the conversion of objects back to XML format. By utilizing this API, developers can easily map the structure of the XML data to the corresponding object model, and vice versa, without needing to write custom code for each transformation.
